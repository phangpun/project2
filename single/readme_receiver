There is 4 part in receiver

Part 1. read data and save data as single_list/double_list.
All data of input file are converted to list_elem and saved to one single_list/double_list.
And check the number of message.

Part 2. sort all data by message number
I make pointer array referring to single_list/double_list whose size is (message_number).
Each list has data which have same message number

Part 3. sort all data by packet number
After Part 2, what we care is sorting data by packet number.
Sorting rule is that if same packet number then remove previous one and 
if next packet number is smaller than previous one then swap data

Part 4. write the result
In writting process, if there is the gap bigger than 1, WARNNING is written.

Time check is done from Part 1 to Part4.
